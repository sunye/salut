| [[service-instance-name, Service Instance Name]] Service Instance Name
| A Service Instance Names is composed of an Instance, a Service and a Domain.
| `Service Instance Name = <Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>`
| `Zealous Lizard's Tune Studio._music._tcp.local.`

| Instance Name (aka Huma, readable service intance name)
|Â The <Instance> portion of the Service Instance Name is a user-friendly name consisting of arbitrary Net-Unicode text
| `Joe's Music Libray`, `Canon MG5300 series`
|

| Service (aka Service type)
| The <Service> portion of the Service Instance Name consists of a pair
of DNS labels, following the convention already established for SRV
records.
| The first label of the pair is an underscore
character followed by the Service Name.  The Service Name
identifies what the service does and what application protocol it
uses to do it.  The second label is either "_tcp" (for application
protocols that run over TCP) or "_udp" (for all others).
|

| Domain Name
|  The <Domain> portion of the Service Instance Name specifies the DNS
subdomain within which those names are registered.  It may be
"local.", meaning "link-local Multicast DNS" [RFC6762], or it may be
a conventional Unicast DNS domain name, such as "ietf.org.",
"cs.stanford.edu.", or "eng.us.ibm.com."  Because Service Instance
Names are not host names, they are not constrained by the usual rules
for host names [RFC1033] [RFC1034] [RFC1035], and rich-text service
subdomains are allowed and encouraged
